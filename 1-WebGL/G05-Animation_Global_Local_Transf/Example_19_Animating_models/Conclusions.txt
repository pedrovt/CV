Back Face culling : verifies if a face is going to be hidden (back face) or not
                    works with 1 convex model or several convex model outside the view line of other 
                    when a model is partially hiding another, it's not enough, the last model to be drawn will be on the front, even if it's smaller and thus should be in the back

                    Use depth test instead (completely substitutes the Back-Face Culling test)
                    gl.enable( gl.DEPTH_TEST );
